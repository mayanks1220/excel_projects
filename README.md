I'm excited to share my project where I analyzed and created an insightful report for the Vrinda Store using Google Sheets. 

📌𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲

The Vrinda Store Annual Report project aims to provide valuable insights into the store's performance, analyze customer behavior, and boost customer sales.

• Compare sales and orders using a single chart?
• Identify the month with the highest sales and orders?
• Determine who purchased more - men or women in 2022?
• Analyze different order statuses in 2022?
• List the top 3 states contributing to sales?
• Examine the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders?
• Identify the channel contributing to maximum sales?
• Determine the highest selling category?
